Summary:
This PowerShell script was created as a way to retain a record of all comments submitted on videos by a single author.  The data is saved in XML files which are human readable.  No effort to de-duplicate data is made.

Script Configuration:
1)  Edit the PowerShell script and find the first two script lines (below the comments).
2)  Change the string value $author of 'TODO' to contain the common video author.
3)  Change the string value $archivepath of 'TODO' to folder where you want the XML files saved.


Schedule Script Execution:
At this point you can run the script manually or setup a scheduled task.  The following instructions define that process.
4) Create a new Scheduled Task
5) TODO
